About this project:

This project specifically showcases my knowledge of html, and css. It is a wonderful portfolio project to see how I understand colors and spacing and how I can manipulate both to create a smooth looking website.

NOTE: There is no interactive javascript, as I wanted to show how my websites can come across as professional and not look too complicated.
